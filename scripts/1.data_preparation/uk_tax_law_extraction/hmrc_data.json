    "content": "Section 336 ITEPA 2003 Modern technology allows increasing numbers of employees to carry out some or all of the duties of their employment in their own homes. When an employee's home is a workplace, a deduction from earnings is permitted: under section 336 ITEPA 2003 for household expenses, see EIM32810 in a few cases, under section 337 ITEPA 2003 for the cost of travel from home to another workplace, see EIM32370 - see also EIM31330 for travel in the employee’s own vehicle This page and the pages that follow contain guidance on how to decide whether an employee's home is a workplace and, if it is, what expenses can be deducted. Before a deduction can be permitted for a household expense it must be demonstrated that the expense has been incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment, see EIM31630 and EIM31660 . Those are the statutory conditions imposed by section 336 ITEPA 2003. HMRC accepts that those conditions are met where the following circumstances apply: the duties that the employee performs at home are substantive duties of the employment. “Substantive duties” are duties that an employee has to carry out and that represent all or part of the central duties of the employment (see EIM32780 ) those duties cannot be performed without the use of appropriate facilities no such appropriate facilities are available to the employee on the employer’s premises ( or the nature of the job requires the employee to live so far from the employer’s premises that it is unreasonable to expect them to travel to those premises on a daily basis) at no time either before or after the employment contract is drawn up is the employee able to choose between working at the employer’s premises or elsewhere The examples in EIM32790 illustrate how those conditions will apply in a range of different circumstances. If one or more of those conditions is not met it is likely that the employee will not satisfy the statutory tests in section 336. However, employees do of course have the right to appeal to the First–tier Tribunal if they believe that they satisfy the statutory conditions. Any case where agreement cannot be reached can be brought before the First-tier Tribunal as described in EIM31706 . Relationship with exempt homeworking payments The deduction for an employee’s homeworking expenses under section 336 should not be confused with the exemption under section 316A which applies to certain homeworking payments that employers may make, see EIM01472 onwards. The interaction between the deduction and the exemption is explained at EIM32825 ."

    "content": "Section 336 ITEPA 2003 Tax years 2006 to 2007 onwards This guidance only applies where an employee’s home is a workplace, see EIM32760 . It is a condition for relief under section 336 ITEPA 2003 that the expenses must be incurred “wholly and exclusively” “in the performance of” the employee’s duties, see EIM31660 . In practice that means that relief can only be allowed for: the additional unit costs of gas and electricity consumed while a room is being used for work the metered cost of water used “in the performance of the duties” (if any) - as regards water rates, see EIM32820 the unit costs of business telephone calls (including “dial up” internet access). It may be difficult for employees to calculate the exact amount of the allowable additional costs that they’ve incurred as a result of working at home. For ease of administration, you may accept that employees who satisfy the conditions for relief (see EIM32760 ) are entitled to a deduction of £6 per week, or £26 per month for monthly paid employees, (exclusive of the cost of business telephone calls) for each week that they’re required to work at home, without having to justify that figure. Employees who wish to deduct more than £6 per week/£26 per month will be expected to keep records and to be able to show how their figure has been calculated. The £6 per week/£26 per month rate applies from 6 April 2020. Prior to this period (tax years 2011 to 2012 - 2019 to 2020) the rate that could be claimed was £4 per week or £18 per month for monthly paid employees. Employees can check if they’re eligible to make a claim here . This is similar to our approach to section 316A ITEPA 2003 under which employers can make tax-free and NICs-free expenses payments to employees who work at home under “homeworking arrangements”. See Tax Bulletin 68 (December 2003) and EIM01472 onwards. The interaction between the deduction and the exemption is explained at EIM32825 . Tax years 2005 to 2006 and earlier For 2005 to 2006 and earlier tax years it was HMRC practice to include council tax, and rent, in the expenses qualifying for relief. For detailed guidance on the approach to be adopted for 2005 to 2006 and earlier years, see SE32810 onwards."

    "content": "Note: with effect from 6 April 2016, a statutory exemption for trivial benefits came into effect. This page explains HMRC’s approach to trivial benefits for tax years 2015 to 2016 and earlier. For tax years 2016 to 2017 onwards, see EIM21864 . In some cases you may be asked by an employer to treat a benefit as exempt from tax, on the grounds that the cash equivalent (Section 203(1) ITEPA 2003) of the benefit taxable on the employee (or on each of the employees concerned if there is more than one of them) is so trivial as to be not worth pursuing. This is sometimes referred to as ‘de minimis’ grounds. There is no general statutory limit below which benefits are not taxable. However that does not mean that you should insist that every trivial benefit should be included on a form P11D or included in a PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA), irrespective of the administrative burdens on both the employer and the HMRC in handling P11Ds and PSAs. When considering requests use common sense, bearing in mind the guidance at EIM21861 . Strike a balance between sensible practical administration of the tax system and the need to deter employers from providing what is in reality part of the remuneration of their employees in a form that seeks to exploit that practical administration. Do not discriminate against large employers by seeking tax in circumstances where you would not if only a few employees were involved. See EIM21862 for what to do if you agree to the employer’s request."

    "content": "To be deductible from the earnings of an employment an expense must be incurred wholly and exclusively in the performance of the duties of the employment. The words “wholly” and “exclusively” prevent a deduction for expenditure that serves a dual purpose, a business purpose and a non-business purpose. The wholly and exclusively rule does not apply to travel expenses . An example of dual purpose expenditure is money spent on ordinary clothing that is worn at work. Clothing that is worn both in work and out of work obviously has a dual purpose and so no deduction is allowed. However, even if the clothing is only worn at work no deduction is allowed. This is because at one and the same time the clothing has the purpose of providing cover and comfort to the employee as well as the purpose of being suitable for work, see EIM31663 . You can allow a deduction for the whole or part of a single expense that has a dual purpose in 2 circumstances: where an apportionment can be made between a part that is incurred wholly and exclusively in the performance of the duties of the employment and a part that is not, an apportioned part can be deducted where the non-business purpose is merely incidental the whole expense can be deducted Example EIM31665 deals with an expense that cannot be apportioned. Example EIM31617 deals with a benefits charge that can be apportioned."

    "content": "Section 62 ITEPA 2003 The release or writing off of a loan made to an employee by an employer is taxable as “earnings” within Section 62 ITEPA 2003 if the writing off can only be ascribed to the fact that the borrower is an employee. It is earnings for the year the loan is written off. In Clayton v Gothorp (47TC168) a county council made a loan to a health visitor to enable her to take a full-time training course. Under the terms of the agreement with her employer the obligation to repay the loan was to be cancelled if she served the council as a health visitor for a further period after the end of the course. She did so and claimed the lapse of the obligation to repay the loan did not make it a chargeable emolument. The High Court held it was a profit from the employment for the year of assessment in which the obligation to repay ceased. For directors and employees (for 2015/16 and earlier only) the writing off of a loan may be taxable under the benefits code if it is not taxable as earnings within Section 62 (see EIM26114 and EIM21740 onwards)."

    "content": "When does interest arise? ITTOIA05/S370 provides that tax is charged on the full amount of interest arising in the tax year. This means that a person receiving interest cannot set off any interest payable, bank charges or similar amounts against sums chargeable under ITTOIA05/S369. Interest ‘arises’ when it is received or made available to the recipient. Interest has been made available if it is credited to an account on which the account holder is free to draw. For additional guidance on when interest arises see SAIM2400 . Jonathan has a building society account, on which interest is credited every 31 December. He is free to make withdrawals from the account, at 30 days’ notice, but has not withdrawn money for many years. On 31 December 2017 he receives interest of £524, he should return the interest as income of year ended 5 April 2018, even though he has not withdrawn it. Interest can in practice often be treated as arising when it becomes due and payable. However, if a taxpayer does not actually receive interest (or have it credited to an account) until a later date, it does not normally form part of his or her taxable income until it is received. Sam entered into a five year fixed-term bond on 6 April 2017. The bond credits interest to Sam’s account annually on the 31 December. Sam can only gain access to both the annual interest and the principal in advance of 5 April 2022 if a penalty is paid for early access. Since the terms and conditions of the bond allow Sam to draw on the funds, although with a penalty, the interest arises and is taxable each year as it is credited. If the terms and conditions of the bond did not allow access until maturity, the interest would arise and be taxed at that point. In January 2017, Jennifer makes a loan of £5,000 to her cousin to help him set up a business. They agree that interest will be payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 5% per annum. But the business initially struggles, and Jennifer does not receive any interest until June 2018 when, after she threatens legal action, her cousin repays the debt along with interest arrears of £875. Jennifer is not required to pay any tax on the interest until 2018/19 when it arises. However, the whole £875 is taxable when she receives it. She cannot spread the arrears of interest over the years in which it accrued. Interest on a judicial award should normally be regarded as arising on the date on which it is paid. Decided cases which embody these general principles include Dewar v CIR (19TC561), Dunmore v McGowan (52TC307), Parkside Leasing Ltd v Smith (58TC282), and Peracha v Miley (63TC444). Cases where there is the potential for a Ponzi (and Ponzi-type) schemes to be involved in the return of interest contact Financial Products team at BAI for advice. Top of page"

    "content": "Expenditure on a house, flat or other property that the landlord occupies himself or herself isn’t normally allowed as a deduction in computing property business profits because it does not satisfy the ‘wholly and exclusively’ rule. Where a landlord genuinely runs the property business from home they may claim the extra business costs that they incur - such as the cost of extra lighting and heating. Where a specific part of their home is used exclusively for running the property business for a significant amount of time, whether continuously or at particular times, then a proportion of all fixed expenses referable to that room may be deducted. Examples might be rent they pay to their own landlord for their home, repairs, property insurance - as well as lighting and heating. There is alternative guidance if the expenses are particularly high (see below). Similar common-sense principles apply where a landlord lets a part of their home. That is, they need to split expenses between private use and rental use. Periods when their home is unoccupied will normally count as non-business use unless a definite part is set aside to let and they are actively seeking a tenant. Sometimes there may be general overhead expenses of running a property business. For example, in a large business employees may repair and decorate both the landlord’s private accommodation and commercial properties while office staff organise the work. An appropriate proportion of both the direct expenses (say the wages of painters) and the administrative staff needs to be allocated to the private work and excluded from the property business profit computation. It is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules because circumstances vary enormously. The aim is for the property business deductions to reflect the commercial use of the property in a fair and reasonable way. Interest on a loan on landlord’s own home that is partly let Interest on a loan for the purchase or improvement of a landlord’s only or main residence may also be split in the way outlined in the previous paragraphs. Relief for the business element may then be claimed in computing property business profits. For more about interest see PIM2050 onwards. Exceptionally heavy expenses incurred on landlord’s own home The previous paragraphs explain the usual case where the running expenses for a home remain at about the same level each year. The expenses attributable to the property business may need to take account of unusual factors in order to produce a fair result. For example, it might not be fair to split heavy expenditure on repairing a roof in a particular year on a simple time or area basis between the let or office part of the home and the private part if the customer has lived there for thirty years but only let part (or used part as the property business office) for two years. Here the bulk of the expense on the roof arises out of private use of the house and a further restriction is needed to reflect the true business use of the home. The adjustment can also work the other way. For example, where the whole property was let for twenty years and the customer has only occupied part for two years. Here it may be fairer to attribute more than a proportionate share of the cost to the property business."
